# sparkQueries

This program uses scala, spark, and a hive database to run queries and find meaningful trends in the data. 

## Technologies Used
* Spark 2.3.1

## Getting Started
This was run on Windows, using IntelliJ.
To run this yourself:
* Make sure java 8 is installed on your machine
* Install the scala plugin on IntelliJ
* Install [winutils](https://medium.com/big-data-engineering/how-to-install-apache-spark-2-x-in-your-pc-e2047246ffc3). Install where you want, but my code assumes it's installed at `C:\\winutils`
